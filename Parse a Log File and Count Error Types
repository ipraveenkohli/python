Given a log file, count how many times each log level appears (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

INFO Server started
ERROR Database connection failed
WARNING Disk space low
ERROR Timeout occurred


def count_log_levels(filename):
    counts = {"INFO": 0, "WARNING": 0, "ERROR": 0}

    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            # Your logic here
            pass

    return counts


print(count_log_levels("log.txt"))
